First, the processor clears and reassigns r2, r3, and r4 to be "pointers" to the memory addresses of X, Y, and N. For the arrays X and Y,
the address stored is the address of the first element. For N, the address is loaded and then replaced with the value (0x00000006). Then, it copies each
element of the X array into the Y array and iterates both of the r2 and r3 pointers so that they point at the next element of the array. The value at r4
is used as a decrementing counter, counting down from 6 to 0; once it hits zero, the loop breaks and the program finishes.

Approximately equivalent C:
void main() {
    // definitions
    int x[6]= {5, 3, -6, 19, 8, 12};
    int y[6] = {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0};

    // emulating the decrementing counter that fills the first element first
    for(int n = 6; n > 0; n--) {
        y[6-n] = x[6-n]; 
    }
    return;
}
